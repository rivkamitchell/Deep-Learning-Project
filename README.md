# A law of large numbers

Neural networks are enormously valuable tools in tasks related to classification and automation. As
a result or their practical strength, a significant interest in the development of our understanding of
neural networks from a mathematical standpoint has evolved. In contribution to this understanding
Sirignano and Spiliopoulos [1] analyze the asymptotic behaviour of a single-layer neural network,
and prove that under suitable scaling the empirical distribution of its parameters converges to the
solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. Their result can be seen as a law of large numbers
for the empirical distribution of the parameters of a single-layer neural network. The code in this sample aims to provide empirical evidence to support their theory.
